Tests
* Write more test cases because of the current tests does not cover much of the code.
* Create API documentation.

Database
* Replace MockDatabase class with the real database and add the data there.

Container
* Add Dockerfile in the root directory that you can build a docker image. After that you can move the image in your production server.

Error handling
* Add a better error handling because now it does not follow functional style in every places.

Spring profiles
* Add a different dev and prod profiles in application.yaml file.

Other
* Developer Tools dependency would be nice because it's contains auto reload.
* Use Spring Security to secure url endpoints.
* Add Spring Boot Actuator that you can get useful information from your application. Then you can also save custom Metrics data.
